However, the very spot Rosolie and his team filmed is under threat: the lower Las Piedras River is being infiltrated by loggers, miners, and farmers following the construction of the Trans-Amazon highway.

But while their protests captured the spotlight momentarily, Borneo's forests continued to be destroyed at rapid rates, undermining traditional communities that are dependent on these ecosystems for food, shelter, medicine, clean water, and spiritual inspiration. Nomadic tribes are now but a memory in Borneo, but other tribal groups continue to fight for their forests by seeking legal recognition of their lands and blocking destructive projects, including oil palm plantations, logging operations, and large-scale hydroelectric projects. Helping them is The Borneo Project, a Berkeley-based non-profit that works in partnership with indigenous communities and the small non-profits that support them.","author":"Rhett Butler","lat":"0.0","lon":"0.0","thumbnail":"http:\/\/photos.mongabay.com\/12\/0710lede150.jpg","keywords":["featured","rhett butler","borneo","malaysia","green","environment","interviews","forest people","rainforest people","logging","forestry","corruption","dams","asia","southeast asia","rainforests","forests","tribal groups","indigenous people","indigenous rights"]},{"guid":"9768","published":"2012-07-02T20:28:00Z","updated":"2012-07-04T04:59:10Z","loc":"http:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2012\/0702-rainforests-to-palm-oil-photos.html","title":"In pictures: Rainforests to palm oil","description":"In late May I had the opportunity to fly from Kota Kinabalu in Malaysian Borneo to Imbak Canyon and back.

Verdant forests and stunning coral reefs, combined with high levels of species endemism, make it a top biodiversity hotspot. But pressure on the region's natural resources is mounting. Mining projects, conversion of forests for plantations, overfishing, and the expansion of a commercial bushmeat trade is endangering some of Sulawesi's most charismatic animals, including the distinctive Sulawesi crested black macaque. Found only in North Sulawesi, the crested black macaque could be one of Indonesia's most iconic conservation symbols, but relatively few people know of its existence. And the locals who do may be inclined to eat it as a delicacy.

Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, Head of the Indonesian President\u2019s Delivery Unit for Development Monitoring and Oversight (UKP4) and Chair of the REDD+ Task Force, said an effort to develop a map of Indonesia's forests and forest concessions has been completed, although the Ministry of Forestry has yet to deliver the map to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, missing last Friday's deadline.

This beautiful, but elusive, feline was filmed sitting docilely for the camera and chasing a bat. The least-known of Africa's wild cat species, the African golden cat has been difficult to study because it makes its home deep in the Congo rainforest. However, researchers didn't capture the cat on video in an untrammeled, pristine forest, but in a well-managed logging concession by Precious Woods Inc., where scientist's cameras also photographed gorillas, elephants, leopards, and duikers.

The tool has even allowed scientists to document animals new to science or feared extinct. But as important as camera traps have become, they are still prohibitively expensive for many conservationists and require many grueling hours in remote forests. A new paper in Current Biology, however, announces an incredibly innovative and cheaper way of recording rare mammals: seek out the leeches that feed on them. The research found that the presence of mammals, at least, can be determined by testing the victim's blood for DNA stored in the leech.","author":"Jeremy Hance","lat":"0.0","lon":"0.0","thumbnail":"http:\/\/travel.mongabay.com\/malaysia\/150\/borneo_3683.JPG","keywords":["strange","science","conservation","happy-upbeat environmental","in-situ conservation","mammals","animals","wildlife","endangered species","critically endangered species","saving species from extinction","saola","cryptozoology","cryptic species","jeremy hance","green","environment","rainforest animals","southeast asia","vietnam","asia","technology","technology and conservation","featured","archive"]}]
